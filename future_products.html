    The iPhone 15 and 15 Pro models are expected in September, which is Apple's typical iPhone refresh month. The iPhone 15 models will be the first with USB-C instead of Lightning, and there could be minor design changes in store. We are expecting a 6.1-inch iPhone 15, a 6.7-inch iPhone 15 Plus, a 6.1-inch iPhone 15 Pro, and a 6.7-inch iPhone 15 Pro Max, though the "Pro Max" could get a new "Ultra" naming scheme this year.
